# PlaneGame
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/AXnYCZr_t9A>
#### Description:This is a simple little game I made using python with the help of the pygame library. In the game, you play a plane with three lives and need to use the ↑↓←→ keys to avoid the collision of enemy planes or the bullets they fire. There are two types of enemy aircraft, red and purple. The red ones do not fire bullets and the purple ones do. No matter which enemy aircraft hits their body, their health will be deducted. In order to avoid continuous deduction of health after the aircraft encounters an enemy plane, I set up the invincibility time when deducting blood to avoid continuous damage calculation. After running the code, you will see an interface called menu. Click start to enter the game and click quit to exit the game. After the aircraft's health value returns to zero, the Game over interface will pop up. Click the menu button to return to the menu interface.
