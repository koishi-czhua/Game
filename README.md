# PlaneGame
#### Video Demo:  <https://youtu.be/AXnYCZr_t9A>
#### Description:This is a simple little game I made using python with the help of the pygame library. In the game, you play a plane with three lives and need to use the ↑↓←→ keys to avoid the collision of enemy planes or the bullets they fire. There are two types of enemy aircraft, red and purple. The red ones do not fire bullets and the purple ones do. No matter which enemy aircraft hits their body, their health will be deducted.
